# [13-2] hls-m3u8 package usage guide

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Research and produce a concise usage guide for `github.com/Eyevinn/hls-m3u8/m3u8` to ensure correct API usage. Per policy 2.1.9, include essential examples (create media playlist, append segments, atomic encode/write, discontinuity handling, version calculation) and date-stamp the document. Link to upstream docs.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Provide a self-contained guide covering core operations needed by our playlist manager.
- Include minimal, copyable code snippets for common operations.
- Cite upstream repository and relevant references.

### Technical Requirements
- Create a guide file named `13-2-hls-m3u8-guide.md` in `docs/delivery/13/`.
- Sections: Overview, Installation, Core Types, Common Operations, Edge Cases, Examples, References (links).
- Use examples aligned with our target (4s TS, sliding window, atomic writes).

## Implementation Plan

1) Review upstream repo and examples to identify canonical API usage.
2) Draft guide with code snippets for: NewMediaPlaylist, Append, Encode/String, Discontinuity, MediaSequence, TargetDuration, CalcMinVersion.
3) Add references and date-stamp; ensure clarity and brevity.
4) Submit for review and incorporate feedback.

## Test Plan

### Objective
Ensure developers can follow the guide to build a minimal working playlist.

### Success Criteria
- Code samples compile in our project context.
- Atomic write pattern is clear and correct.
- Discontinuity and version examples are accurate.

## Verification

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Guide exists at `docs/delivery/13/13-2-hls-m3u8-guide.md`
- [x] Contains examples for create/append/encode/discontinuity/targetduration
- [x] Includes links to upstream references

## Files Modified
